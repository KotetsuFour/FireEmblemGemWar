Rose Quartz
Here we are. The Sky Arena
Rose Quartz
If the Quartzes at the Prime Kindergarten wouldn't join us, maybe some here will.
Pearl
I hope so, my Quartz. Soldiers are very important for fighting a war.
Rose Quartz
Pearl, you don't have to call me "my Quartz". Just call me Rose.
Pearl
Understood, my Rose.
Rose Quartz
*sigh* I saw that coming.
Rose Quartz
Just remember the plan. Let me give my speech, and if things go south...
Pearl
Yes, then I get to use my new spear that you graciously gave me at the Shell!
Rose Quartz
*chuckle* You mean the spear you begged me to give you.
Rose Quartz
Alright, it's time. Wish me luck!
Pearl
Good luck, my Rose!

Gems of Earth! Listen to me!
Rose Quartz
Look around at what you are building. Is this really what you want?
Rose Quartz
I have made an amazing discovery. This planet is the home of a diverse ecosystem of organic life!
Rose Quartz
I’ve seen them for myself! The lives they live and the things they do are extraordinary!
Rose Quartz
But our invasion is destroying their home. If we continue, nothing will be left.
Rose Quartz
Will you destroy this life, or will you join it?

Get her!
Rose Quartz
Well, here we go again.
