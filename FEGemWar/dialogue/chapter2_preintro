The Crystal Gems, led by Rose Quartz, began sabotaging the colonial effort.

With this, Pink Diamond had the perfect excuse to end the colony. Or so she thought.

Pink Diamond
Rose Quartz has become a significant threat. She has turned several of my Gems against me.
Yellow Diamond
Well I think the solution is simple.
Pink Diamond
We should stop the colony!
Yellow Diamond
I was going to say you ought to bubble all of your Rose Quartzes.
Yellow Diamond
They are a new model of quartz. For all we know, they could all be just as defective as this one.
Pink Diamond
But that isn't enough!
Yellow Diamond
Capturing the other Rose Quartzes will work as a scare tactic.
Yellow Diamond
And if not, it should be easy enough still to hunt down these few traitors.
Pink Diamond
You don’t understand! They’ve organized into a rebellion! They’re calling themselves the Crystal Gems!
Yellow Diamond
Ugh. Blue, you handle this.

Pink Diamond
I don’t understand why you won’t just let me leave the Earth alone!
Blue Diamond
“Leave the Earth alone”? Is that what you’re asking of us?
Pink Diamond
It's just--
Blue Diamond
But this is what you wanted.
Blue Diamond
You begged us for a colony of your own. And now all you want to do is be rid of it!
Blue Diamond
First, there were too many organics, then their cities were too difficult to dismantle.
Blue Diamond
And now these “Crystal Gems”? We’re tired of your excuses, Pink!
Pink Diamond
...
Blue Diamond
This Rose Quartz can’t hurt you. You can’t be swayed by a few unruly Gems.
Pink Diamond

Blue Diamond
Enough!
Blue Diamond
You must understand. You are a Diamond. Everyone on this planet is looking to you.
Blue Diamond
You don't even have to do anything. Just smile and wave.
Blue Diamond
Show everyone you are unfazed by this little uprising.
Blue Diamond
Your Gems will fall into line, and these Crystal Gems will be no more.
Blue Diamond
As long as you are there to rule, this colony will be completed.

Pink Diamond
Pearl? What are you doing with that sword?

Pearl
Bringing it to you, my Diamond! It’s a new sword that Bismuth made especially for you.
Pearl
She says it’s not balanced entirely correctly and that she’ll make another one to replace it.
Pink Diamond
That’s not how you give someone a sword. I thought you were about to shatter me.
Pearl
Oh! I’m terribly sorry!
Pink Diamond
They didn’t listen, Pearl. As usual. Looks like the war will go on.
Pink Diamond
Thanks for bringing me the sword. Let’s go find somewhere to use it.
