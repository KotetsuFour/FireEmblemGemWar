Rose Quartz
It’s a good thing we got away.
Rose Quartz
And it looks like we even inspired some Gems to join us!
Pearl
Wait. I heard something... I think we have company...
Rose Quartz
Be careful.

You’re the Bismuth from the arena.
Bismuth
Yeah. I figured out what I want to do. I don’t want to build arenas and spires.
Bismuth
I want to make weapons!
Rose Quartz
Weapons?
Bismuth
Is that too--
Rose Quartz
No, that’s wonderful! In fact, it’s just what we need!
Bismuth
Well then I guess I’m joining you! The Diamonds don’t have use for a Bismuth who makes weapons.
Rose Quartz
No, the Diamonds wouldn’t understand.
Rose Quartz
But we’re glad to have you here in the... um...
Pearl
The Crystal Gems!
Bismuth
The "Crystal Gems"?
Rose Quartz
The "Crystal Gems"?
Pearl
We’re a group of Gems that have “dissolved” off of Homeworld’s structure.
Pearl
Then we deposited onto each other to form an organized lattice.
Pearl
Like a crystal.
Rose Quartz
I love it! Bismuth, welcome to the Crystal Gems!
